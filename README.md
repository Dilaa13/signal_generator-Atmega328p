# ATmega328P Signal Generator using MCP4921 DAC

This project implements a **waveform signal generator** using the ATmega328P microcontroller and the MCP4921 12-bit DAC. The purpose is to simulate a working digital-to-analog waveform generator capable of producing a **sine wave** through SPI communication and visualize it using **Proteus** simulation.

## 🚀 Features

- Generates a **sine wave** using precomputed lookup table values.
- Uses **SPI protocol** to communicate with the MCP4921 DAC.
- Output is buffered through an **LM358 op-amp**.
- Visual debugging via **UART terminal** and **digital oscilloscope** in Proteus.
- Full compilation using **WinAVR (avr-gcc)** and **VS Code** with a Makefile.
- Simulation validated in **Proteus** using `.hex` file output.

## 🧠 Theory of Operation

A **sine wave** is generated by:
1. Computing `N = 64` samples for one full cycle of `sin(2πx)`, scaled to 0–4095 (12-bit range).
2. Sending each value via **SPI** to the MCP4921 at fixed time intervals.
3. The DAC converts the digital value to an analog voltage.
4. The op-amp buffers and amplifies the waveform for smooth output.

> SPI is used in **Master mode**, with MOSI, SCK, and CS configured appropriately.
